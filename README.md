# justforcoupon
I am prob the only person who will ever use this.  My local grocery store has a coupon page through which one can add coupons to a loyalty card.  I want to select every coupon, just in case one day I decide to buy dog treats despite neither having nor knowing any dogs.

Anyway this script, entered via the developer console, will select every coupon on the page.

(Until they change it.)

Written tested and used only in Chrome.  I have no clue why you would ever want to use this in your own work but if you do, observe the license.
